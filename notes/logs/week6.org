* Questions
** What does the inferred reward look like for novelty reward?
*** Hypothesis: (more or less) recover that reward. It is indeed a reward.
But it is the universal reward.

** Can the IRL process be written symmetrically?
See tablet notes.

** How do linear combinations of policies perform in MDPs?

* Implementing Distributions over Rewards + Info Theory.
** First Step: Kernels (Gaussian?)
*** Question: how to push-forward through the RL or IRL processes?
May not be Gaussian at the end


* The Zen Approach
Sometimes there's a

* V
** If there is a reset action, does novelty reward do something interesting?
** A Measure of Accessibility :IMPORTANT:
You want to change in response to a change in reward function,
(or to a lesser degree, transition dynamics?)

The intuition suggests that there's a natural reward that weights center points higher, since there is a lower path to get to them

*** Formalization.
A reward function should be larger if there
